# BasketStat


## About The Project
<!-- project screen shot -->
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project was built with the intention of creating a webapp that serves the purpose of recording basketball scores, which include
player scores, and team scores on the court, which provides a real-time analysis and calculation of team/ player statistics to help 
a local basketball team grow. The idea was that local basketball teams don't have the time and resources to hire an analytics team
to help with analyzing player combinations and track performance. Most team adjustments weren't data driven, and teams miss the 
opportunity to grow. The website also serves as a platform to integrate Posts, player management, score-tracking, and analysis all 
in one place.
